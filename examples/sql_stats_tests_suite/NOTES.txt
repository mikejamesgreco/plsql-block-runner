NOTES.txt

This test suite demonstrates the SQL Stats / Explain Plan block.

- Test files call xx_ora_block_driver with blocks.conf in this directory.
- The MAIN reads inputs_json with:
    - sql_stats: options for top_n, include_list, explain_sql, cursor_sql_id, cursor_child, xplan_format
    - run: { plsql: "BEGIN ... END;" } optional snippet to execute under measurement

If V$ views are not accessible to the running schema, stats_delta.supported will be false.
