HTTP Block Framework - Test Suite

All tests use ONE config:
  blocks.conf -> MAIN=XX_BLOCK_MAIN_HTTP_CALL_1.sql

Run any test_*.sql after placing these files into your blocks directory.

Notes:
- httpbin.org is used for HTTP-only tests (no wallet needed).
- HTTPS tests demonstrate failure without a wallet and success once a proper wallet is configured (placeholders included).
- Basic/OAuth tests include CHANGE_ME placeholders; fill with real values.
